# Summary
KEA is an algorithm for extracting keyphrases from text documents. It can be either used for free indexing, where keyphrases are selected from the document itself, or for indexing with a controlled vocabulary. KEA can also be used for automatic tagging.

KEA is implemented in Java and is platform independent. It is an open-source software distributed under the GNU General Public License.

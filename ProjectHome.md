## Summary ##
KEA is an algorithm for extracting keyphrases from text documents. It can be either used for free indexing, where keyphrases are selected from the document itself, or for indexing with a controlled vocabulary. KEA can also be used for automatic tagging.

KEA is implemented in Java and is platform independent. It is an open-source software distributed under the GNU General Public License.

## KEA as a service ##
Joseph Turian has provided an [XML-RPC service for Kea on GitHub](http://github.com/turian/kea-service). He has also written an informative [blog post about this service and keyphrase extraction software](http://metaoptimize.com/blog/2010/08/18/kea-keyphrase-extraction-as-an-xml-rpc-service/) in general.
